# Connections

## Definition

A connection is an object that links two servers and can be defined as  `SOURCE_IP:SOURCE_PORT/DESTINATION_IP:DESTINATION_PORT/CONNECTION_TYPE`.

Any remote interaction or communication between two or more servers relies on connections.

## Types

The connection type identifies the purpose of a given connection.

Usually, `DESTINATION_PORT` alone suffices to identify the type of a connection, but some types allows for multiple or random destination ports.

Below is a breakdown of the connection types.

### SSH

### FTP

### BF

### HTTP

### HTTPS

### X11

### Tor

### DNS

### BGP
