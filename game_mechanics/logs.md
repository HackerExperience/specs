# Logs

### Overview

A log is a text entry containing details about an activity that happened on a server. Every recorded log is appended to a logfile.

A log entry can contain sensitive information, like someone's else IP address or bank account information, thus making it a vital part of the gameplay.

In order to cover their actions, attackers usually delete their logs. However, a deeper dynamic may be achieved by forging logs, thus deceiving or misleading someone to a honeypot or a third-party server.
