# Overview

Guided by the principles outlined above, the game Hacker Experience 2 aim to achieve a number of ambitious goals.

# Hackability

Hacker Experience 2 simulates a world where everything is hackable. Servers, phones, connections, drones and anything that might emerge. In addition to that, the player can interact with elements of the world like entities, buildings and network data flowing through servers.

# Simulation

Above all else, HE2 is a hacking *simulation*. Thus, we aim to simulate reality as accurate as possible, while keeping the game enjoyable.

This means we have an implied suspension of disbelief (or artistic license, if you will). Hacking a system isn't as easy as clicking a number of times on the screen. However, the game would be too complex, or boring (and illegal!) if we were to be faithful to reality at all times. 

Still, it's possible to create a thorough and enjoyable simulation while keeping it simple.

# Simple, but deep

The casual gamer, who wants to have fun and play some times during the week, shall have no trouble playing the game. 

The other end of the gamer spectrum, made by an addicted user who plays for hours, everyday, shall find new challenges through the gameplay.

This poses a design challenge for us: how to create a game that is deep enough for the core gamer yet simple enough for the casual gamer.

# Educate

Even though HE2 is a simulation (see above), real world concepts are applied to the game. After some interaction, the non-technical player will be able to grasp general concepts about computers, data and privacy. We take special pride on the latter: the layman often does not know how applications handle his privacy.

By actually eavesdropping plain-text data sent over the game, 

# Ubiquity

HE2 must have a single requirement: an Internet connection. With that in mind, it's easy to imagine a game that can be run *anywhere*, including: 

- Browsers, (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge)
- Desktops, (Linux, Windows, Mac, *BSD)
- Smartphones, (Android, iOS, WP)
- Tablets,
- Video-game consoles,
- Virtual reality headsets,
- Smartwatches, 
- IoT (toaster, refrigerator, alarm clock...)

As a broke startup, I'm afraid we can't afford to work on a native client to all these devices. But hey, how fun would it be to play HE2 on your microwave? :)

# Accessibility

We aim to create a game to everyone, including those with impairments or disabilities. 

Just like ubiquity, it's hard maintaining accessibility with little to no money. However, we count with the community to help us improve our game accessibility. In  an ideal scenario, we would like to have at least one developer focused solely on accessibility, but that's currently not possible. We hope to be able to change that.
