# Overview

In order to build a platform truly designed for our players, the Hacker Experience brand and its parent company, Neoart Labs, share a number of principles.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of them.

# Openness

The most unique aspect of HE2 is, most certainly, its openness. We want to have a game built by the community, to the community.

We believe that the player should have the **freedom** to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. This is the definition of *free software*. This means the community can fix bugs or glitches, create patches, add features, customize or study it.

Our main objective is to create a software *for* our users, so Hacker Experience 2 is a free software<sup>[free-not-gratis]</sup>.

# Transparency

As a general rule of thumb, we must be the most transparent we can with our community.

We want to **share** everything, including:

- the ups and downs of running an startup, and what we learned with it;
- honest news regarding the game development, whether good or bad ones;
- tools and libraries created to support the game;
- the game itself;
- photos of our pets on our Instagram page.


# Quality

We must provide the best possible *user experience*. It is unacceptable to have a low quality, poorly designed software or user interface. Any report of lack of compliance should be treated as high-priority.

It is important to keep in mind that design and gameplay aren't the only factors of user experience. Support, marketing, orders and performance also affect overall player satisfaction.

# No technical knowledge required

*Everyone* in our audience should enjoy HE2, no matter how diverse it might be. 

Given its unique genre, a good part of the game audience will be composed by people with deep knowledge on computers. Think programmers, software engineers, system administrators, hackers etc. It's safe to assume those will have no problem getting adapted to the game.

However, we expect the other half of our users to have no knowledge on computer science, or computer programming. This should *not* be a problem for them.

The same applies to contributions. Anyone can contribute to the game, even if they are not programmers.

Examples on how the layman can contribute to HE2:

- Reporting errors and bugs.
- Improving translations.
- Improving game design and specifications.
- Submitting ideas to be discussed.
- Spreading the word.
