# Introduction

As a whole, we seek *universal contribution*, i.e. a place where anyone can share their opinion regarding a specific part of the project. In order to achieve universal contribution, we need a framework that is

 - **Simple**, 
 - **Reactive**, so discussions get fast feedback, often;
 - **Clear**, so contributing guidelines can easily be followed;
 

This framework prevents some common problems with OSS. Mainly, we don't want the contributor to feel:

- **intimidated**:
    - "There is nothing useful I can add to these discussions";
    - "I don't understand their commit review process"
    - "So many rules. They won't accept my contributions due to minor errors".
- **frustrated**:
    - "I've submitted this patch but I haven't received any responses yet";
    - "My questions don't get answered"


We've found [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org) to be the best OSS tool that could allow us meet these requirements. However, Phabricator's interface and usability might take some time to get used to.

# Getting started 

- Visit our [development center](https://dev.hackerexperience.com) and create an account (or log in with any social network). Meet Phabricator!

    - First of all, **don't panic**.
    - Phabricator's interface *is* hard-to-use. It might take a while, but you'll get used to it. Don't worry.
    
    
- Now, a quick explanation on how Phabricator works.  
    - Phabricator is an all-in-one (AIO) place to develop, discuss and review HE2. All you need is there.
    - Phabricator is made of many different applications, each with its own purpose. Some of them are:
        - **Maniphest**: the place where you can create a **task**, or bug report, to be analysed and discussed.
        - **Differential** is the code review utility, where developers will discuss and accept/deny changes to HE2 code.
        - **Diffusion**, where all repositories related to, or owned by HE2 are. You can browse their code there.
        - **Conpherence** is a chat utility, where you can join private or public groups and talk about anything. Keep in mind that Conpherence is not the place for important discussions, they belong to Maniphest. It's a nice place to introduce yourself and get help from other contributors.
        - **Projects** allow people to be grouped by interests or content. It works like tags. A question about game-design will belong to the "Game Design" tag (and any other, if relevant). Then, you can find all tasks related to "Game Design".


- Now we will guide you according to how you can/want to help.


# I want to...

## Create a discussion, report a bug, request a feature:

- Go to Maniphest
- On the upper right corner, click "Create task". Select the type of task (Feature Request, Report a bug, ...). If you can't find a correct type, select "Custom Task".
- Type what you want to report/discuss.
- (optional) Add projects related to the task. Start typing something related and see if Phabricator finds any.
- Click on "Create task"

## Ask something

Usually, you'll want to ask questions on Ponder, a Q&A phabricator application pretty much like StackOverflow or Quora. In some rare cases, however, a question needs proper discussion or review, so creating a task is the way to go. Below is a simple procedure to follow.

- If it's something that needs proper discussion, review or approval, create a task (see 1).
- If it's something personal, go to Conpherence.
    - There, join the room most suitable for your question (use "General" if none fit).
    - Ask :)

## Clone the repository

- a
- b
- c

## Submit a change

- First, make sure there is a task related to your change. If not, create one (see 1), describing your changes and why you did them.

## Create a public project

- Please create a task (see 1) asking about the project, its name and purpose. If approved, we will create the project and give you moderator access to the project.

## I don't know
- See below.

# How can I help the project?

In many ways, even if you are not a developer. Let's go:

## Programmers

- Fix reported bugs (See Tasks with project Bugs).
- Fix TODOs (See Tasks with project TODO)
- Develop new features (See project Feature-Backlog)
- Others (See pynosso, Helix, Pheeb, Curupira, core)
- Related projects:

## System administrators

- Join discussions on tasks about Linux, Docker and many more. Weigh in!

## Network administrators

## Security Engineers

- Help us on tasks tagged with Security.
- Review some critical packages (TODO: link, project).

## Game Designers

- Create the game mechanics with us! See discussions under GameDesign and kindly share your opinion.
- Add feature requests.

## Translators

- Help us translate the game to your favorite language.

## Others / Non-technical / Everyone / Anyone
Stuff that doesn't require specific knowledge (so **anyone** can help).

- Translate the game.
- Suggest new features.
- Spread the word
- Donate / pre-order
