# Objectives

Guided by the principles outlined above, the game Hacker Experience 2 aim to achieve a number of ambitious goals.

## Hackability

## Simulation

Above all else, HE2 is a hacking *simulation*. Thus, we aim to simulate reality as accurate as possible, while keeping the game enjoyable.

This means we have an implied suspension of disbelief (or artistic license, if you will). Hacking a system isn't as easy as clicking a number of times on the screen. However, the game would be too complex, or boring (and illegal!), if we were to be faithful to reality at all times. 

Still, it's possible to create a thorough and enjoyable simulation while keeping it simple.

## Simple, but deep

The casual gamer, who wants to have fun and play some times during the week, shall have no trouble playing the game. 

The other end of the gamer spectrum, made by an addicted user who plays for hours, everyday, shall find new challenges through the gameplay.

This poses a design challenge for us: how to create a game that is deep enough for the core gamer yet simple enough for the casual gamer.

## Educate

## Ubiquity

HE2 must have a single requirement: an Internet connection. With that in mind, it's easy to imagine a game that can be run *anywhere*, including: 

- Browsers, (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge)
- Desktops, (Linux, Windows, Mac, *BSD)
- Smartphones, (Android, iOS, WP)
- Tablets,
- Video-game consoles,
- Virtual reality headsets,
- Smartwatches, 
- IoT (toaster, refrigerator, alarm clock...)

As a broke startup, I'm afraid we can't afford to work on a native client to all these devices. But hey, how fun would it be to play HE2 on your microwave? :)

## Accessibility

We aim to create a game to everyone, including those with impairments or disabilities. 

Just like ubiquity, it's hard maintaining accessibility with little to no money. However, we count with the community to help us improve our game accessibility. In  an ideal case scenario, we would like to have at least one developer focused only on accessibility.
